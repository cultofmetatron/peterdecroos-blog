    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lexical scoping (scoping accordinng to location in source code) is probably one of
the most powerful features a programming language can have.
Today, I'm going to show you how to use lexical scoping to
create powerful abstractions. I will begin by introducing the concept of scope.
From there I will introduce a few rules for figuring out the scope of your variables
in javascript and then introduce the concept of a closure and how it will make you
positivly badass at Javascript.</p>

<h2>What is a scope?</h2>

<p>I'm assuming you have written code before. Hell, I'd dare assume you've written a <em>var.</em></p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
var variableName = "variable value";
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>What does it mean to use the <em>var</em> keyword? As you may know, good javascript has you
prepend all your variables with var. Most will also advocate wrapping all your code in
an immediatly invoked function.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
//this is being declared in the global scope.
//its functionally equivilant to window.foo or just plain foo
var foo = "super bar";</p>

<p>(function() {
  var foo = "inner bar";
  console.log('this foo refers to the foo inside this function ', foo);
})();
/<em> I don't always create inline annonymous functions, but when I do, I
immediatly invoke them. Live dynamically my friends &lt;3 </em>/</p>

<p>console.log('this one will print the top level: ', foo);</p>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Let's start with this relativly simple example to begin growing some understanding.
Internally, the interpreter/compiler represents scopes with a tree (in simple cases, just a linked list).
At each node in the tree is a dictionary of values that we refer to with the variable
names from your source code. When we refer to foo, the interpreter (or the compiler at compile time)
will look for it in the most immediate scope. If it doesn't find a value there, it will look
up the scope tree until it finds a node with a matching key/val and uses it for the current instruction.</p>

<p>Look at that previous code sample. If there wasn't a <em>var foo</em> at the top of the function,
The interpreter would look for scope[foo] and find that it isn't there. It would then look for an
entry named <em>foo</em> in the current scope's parent. That is the global scope where
the variable foo exists. It refers to the value "super bar."</p>

<h2>Creating scopes and determining the current scope's parent</h2>

<p>The rules for creating scopes differ between languages. In Javascript, we start new scopes with a
function.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
var foo = "global scope";
var goo = "ber";
(function() {
  var foo = "inner scope";
  (function() {</p>

<pre><code>var foo = "super inner scope bro!";
</code></pre>

<p>  })();
})();
{% endcodeblock%}</p>

<p>This creates a tree with three nodes we can visually represent
in pseudo-coffeescript.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:coffeescript %}
 scope_chain = global:</p>

<pre><code>              variables:
                foo: "global scope";
                goo: "ber"
              children:
                inner_scope:
                  variables:
                    foo: "inner scope"
                  children:
                    super_inner_scope:
                      variables:
                        foo : "super inner scope bro!"
</code></pre>

<p>{% endcodeblock%}</p>

<p>As you can see, we have three nodes and there are variables that are available
at each node. If you try to access a variable, the interpreter will look up the nodes
until it finds an entry that matches.</p>

<p>Lets go deeper. How about we not even bother with immediatly invoking the function.
How would that work?</p>

<p>The simple answer is that it changes nothing. The scope chain rules are consistent. The only difference
is that we now have two ways variables can enter the scope.</p>

<ol>
<li>Through the scope tree, variables in parent scopes are available.</li>
<li>When variables are injected in via the function arguments which can be
pulled from some other scope where we invoke the function.</li>
</ol>


<p>We delay the instantiation of the scopes until they are invoked later in the program.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
  //scope A
  var binder = function(st) {</p>

<pre><code>//scope B
var state = st
return {
  set: function(newState) {
    //scope C
    state = newState;
    return state;
  },
  get: function() {
    //scope E
    return state;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
{% endcodeblock%}</p>

<p>Scope order is created lexically. Each new function definition in the source (ie: text, hence the lexical)
is being read into the interpreter as a place to mark a new node in the scope chain on invocation.
I mentioned that the scope datastructure resembles a tree because both Scope C and E
belong to B as siblings. B in turn, belongs to A.</p>

<p>None of these functions are being invoked but the scope lookup rules are locked to A -> B, B-> C, B->E
Things get hairier when we invoke them.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
  //scope A
  var b1 = binder(5);
  b1.get();   // => 5
  b1.set(2); // => 2
  b1.get(); // => 2</p>

<p>{% endcodeblock%}</p>

<p>How on earth is this function maintaining state? The Binder, on invocation, takes the argument 5
and creates a scope according to the rules set forward in the source code of binder.</p>

<p>Now, 2 is in Scope B and being assigned to the variable "state" we instantiated in scope B.
We then return the object back.</p>

<p>The object we get back from calling binder()  has two functions and thus two child
scopes of B, (C, and D) which  we return back to Scope A. via the return.</p>

<p>Now it gets weird. When we call b1.get(), we invoke a function from scope A
which internally has a scope C who's parent scope is scope B. It thus returns a value from scope B
back into scope A. Think of it like a closed loop of scopes. ie: a closure. ;)</p>

<p>This is pretty powerful. b1.set() does something similar only its injecting a variable from scope
A containing 2 into scope E where it is assigned to a variable in scope B and subsuquently returned.
B1.get(), on its next invocation returns the same value stored in that variable from the same scope
into scope A, the top level context.</p>

<p>We can use this to create objects with completely encapsulated states.
This gives us a leg up when trying to wrangle asynchrounous processes.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a function that runs a function passed as an argument after a delay.
while we wait for the function to fire,
we can register functions to be called when the function is resolved.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:javascript %}</p>

<p>  //scope A
  var delay = function(fn, args, timeout) {</p>

<pre><code>//Scope B
var status = "pending"; //how we track what the status of the internal state is
var result; //where we are going to store the result of calling fn.
var deps = []; //where we store registered callbacks.

setTimeout(function() {
  //Scope C
  /* the scope chain from here is A -&gt; B-&gt; C
  this simply calls teh function and allows us to pass in the
  arguments as an array
  */
  result = fn.apply(this, args); //call the function
  status = "done";
  //we run through all the functions in deps and run them one
  //by one.
  deps.forEach(function(dep) {
    //Scope D
    dep.call(this, result);
  });
}, timeout);

//the two objects being returned have access to this scope
//which allows us to invoke them to affect this internal 
//environmental.
return {
  done: function(func) {
    //Scope E
    //A -&gt; B -&gt; C
    if (status === "pending") {
      deps.push(func);
    }
    if (status === "done") {
      func(result);
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  var promise = delay(function(msg) {</p>

<pre><code>//Scope F
return msg + " world";
</code></pre>

<p>  }, ["hello"], 3000);</p>

<p>  //by passing this function to done, you guarantee that
  //when the function passed into delay is called, it will pass
  //the result into the function passed in here.
  promise.done(function(result) {</p>

<pre><code>//Scope G
console.log(result);
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>  //3000 milliseconds later
  //> "hello world"
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Yeah its a wee bit contrived but it illustrates a point. By using a closure to wrap a
bunch of data into this enclosed space, we can hide away some
pretty sophisticated machinery to invert the responsibilty of control. Now the
object maintains the state of the async call to the file and we register functions
that it will call when the async call is resolved. This removes alot of overhead for managing
async functions.</p>

<p>In Node.js, we pass a callback into the third paramater  for the standard library functions.</p>

<p>What if we could apply the same principle and get an object we could pass along functions to
and know it will take care of running them when the file is available?</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
var fileObject = function(fileName, encoding) {
  var fs = require('fs');
  var status = "pending";
  var result_data;
  var result_error;
  var deps_success = [];
  var deps_fail = [];
  var deps_always = [];
  var ret = {};
  encod = encoding || 'utf8';</p>

<p>  fs.readFile(fileName, encoding ,function(err, data) {</p>

<pre><code>result_data = data;
result_error = err;
if (!result_error) {
  deps_success.forEach(function(fn) {
    fn(result_data);
  });
  status = "success";
} else {
  deps_fail.forEach(function(fn) {
    fn(result_error);
  });
  status = "error";
}
deps_always.forEach(function(fn) {
  fn();
});
</code></pre>

<p>  });
  var queueFunction = function(list, fn) {</p>

<pre><code>list.push(fn);
</code></pre>

<p>  };
  var done = function(fn) {</p>

<pre><code>if (status === "done") {
  fn(result_data);
  return ret;
}
if (status === 'pending') {
  queueFunction(deps_success, fn);
  return ret;
}
</code></pre>

<p>  };
  var fail = function(fn) {</p>

<pre><code>if (status === "error") {
  fn(result_error);
}
if (status === "pending") {
  queueFunction(deps_fail, fn);
}
return ret;
</code></pre>

<p>  };
  var always = function(fn) {</p>

<pre><code>if (status === "pending") {
  queueFunction(deps_always, fn);
} else {
  fn();
}
return ret;
</code></pre>

<p>  };
  ret.done = done;
  ret.fail = fail;
  ret.always = always;</p>

<p>  //this exposes the status as a readonly property
  Object.defineProperty(ret, 'status', {</p>

<pre><code>get: function() {
  return status;
},
enumerable: true
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>  return ret;
};</p>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Hey, that wasn't so bad. We return an object of three functions and
it will take care of running the appropriate functions based on the
status of the object's internal async operation when its resolved.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:javascript %}</p>

<p>var newFile = fileObject('./hello.txt');</p>

<p>newFile.done(function(data) {
  console.log('two ' + data);
});</p>

<p>newFile.done(function(data) {
  console.log('one ' + data);
});</p>

<p>newFile.fail(function(err) {
  console.log('the file errored out. returned: ' + err);
});</p>

<p>newFile.always(function() {
  console.log('this always gets called');
});</p>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>In short, lexical scoping and closures are pretty damn awesome.</p>
