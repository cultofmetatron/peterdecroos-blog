    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Internally within node, every object has an id that V8 uses to keep track of these
object. In the same way, when we invoke a request to the operating system to create
a process, the operating system loads the program into memory and assigns it an id
which can be used to track the running program throughout its life cycle.</p>

<p>The id this process is assigned is called a pid and it can be accessed from within
node via process</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><em>Fun fact</em>: if you open another terminal and type "kill -9 (process pid)." You will
have effectivly terminated the process in the other window by having the operating
system directly deliver a kill switch to your running node instance.</p>

<p>The process module is global so we don't need to require it. It gives us alot of
information about the running node instance that we can use in our programs.</p>

<p>Example operations include</p>

<ul>
<li>exiting the program</li>
<li>changing directories/ getting directory information</li>
<li>getting the name of the directory of the start script</li>
<li>retrieving argumenst passed into the command line invocation of the script</li>
</ul>


<h4>process events</h4>

<p>specific to node.js is the ability to bind to occur at process events.</p>

<p>In the case of exit, the event loop terminates. The documentation specifically
mentions events scheduled with setTimeout. Its important to note that this applies
to all asych events as they all operate on setTimeout underneath.</p>

<p><em>Consequently, if you need to write some pertinent information to the disc, Be sure
to use writeFileSync!!</em></p>

<h4>process.kill</h4>

<p>TLDR: Processes can send signals to each other and recieve signals from the ernal</p>

<p>Signals can be compared to events
and event listeners in javascript. kill()'s name is unfortunate since kill
is really a function for sending messages to other processes as OS signals. You will
use this function to tell other processes to go kill themeselves most of the time.</p>

<p>This isn't limited to node processes speaking amongst themeselves. Ever run node and then
exit it using <em>ctrl-c.</em></p>

<p>For a great list of standard unix signals, check out this
<a href="http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~alanjawi/cs449/code/shell/UnixSignals.htm">Awesome Chart</a></p>

<p>We can orginaize them according to their default behaviors.</p>

<ul>
<li>kill requests/reports</li>
<li>error reporting</li>
<li>device access notification</li>
<li>coordinating io</li>
</ul>


<p>We can overide the default behaviors for some of these signals.</p>

<p>You cannot overwrite the kill -9 signal. This is why certain programs can become corrupted
when you kill-9 them. they are not given a chance to save state.</p>

<p>For more information about signals, I found these two guides to be excellent.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.workingwithunixprocesses.com/?utm_source=jstorimer.com&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=bookspage">Working with Unix Processes</a></li>

<p>Signals are a primitive pipeline for relaying messages. If you are looking to build some
form of complex communication pipeline between individual processes,
you are better off doing so over tcp. There are frameworks that facilitate
this such as <a href="http://www.zeromq.org/">zeromq</a> with an
excellent <a href="https://github.com/JustinTulloss/zeromq.node">node binding available</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.peterdecroos.com/blog/2013/04/11/processes-in-node-introduction/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-11T14:26:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.peterdecroos.com/blog/2013/04/11/processes-in-node-introduction</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a language made to exist within the browser, javascript did not originally
come with a way to do process process related tasks. Until Chrome, browser based
javascript was running within the same process as the browser.</p>

<p>In Chrome, every tab runs in its own process. Consequently, your javascript on any given
page runs in its own process. Now that node has brought javascript into the server and far from
the restrictive confines of the browser, We can do intersting things like run other programs from node.</p>

<h3>What is a process?</h3>

<p>Much like the relationship between a Constructor function + its prototypye and the
object created by invoking the <em>new</em> keyword, a process is an operating system level invocation
of some program.</p>

<h3>Process vs Program - a very high level overview</h3>

<p>Imagine the hardrive that powers your computer. Stored on it is a long range of numbers.
For all practical purposes, we can think of it as a long serial stream of bits layed out. with information
encoded on them. At some magical location is the boot sector. When the computer first starts running,
it startsloading binary data from the hardrive into the RAM and then loads this data into the cpu.
At this point we load the master process which we call the operating system kernal.
The kernal then takes care of managing other processes in the system.</p>

<p>At this point, we get to your program. If we were doing this in <em>C</em>, the the compiler would compile your
source code into binary code which follows an executable format. The actual encoding of this binary instruction
stream varies across cpu architectures and operating systems. They do happen to share some
common characteristics. Most of this information is located in the header of the file as information that tells
the operating system that this code is executable and information on how it is to be run.</p>

<h5>Entry Point Address</h5>

<p>At some point in the binary stream of bytes that is your program, there exists the first instruction that
needs to be loaded into the cpu. The Operating System loads this address into memory and queues it up
for running into the cpu.</p>

<h5>Data</h5>

<p>Constants in the process are stored in the data stream in some area where they can be accessed by the
Process as it runs. This includes mathematical constants such as Math.PI or string error messages.</p>

<h5>Symbol and Lookup Tables.</h5>

<p>To properly explain symbol and lookup table, I need to elaborate on what is going on at the
instruction level on your computer. Basicly, it stores the locations of all the variables and function
entry points. in memory.</p>

<h3>Processes verses threads</h3>

<p>The simple $2 answer is that processes have their own copy of all the data and symbol information. In some languages, multiple threads exist within a process and all share the same data. more importantly, you cannot create threads in node.</p>

<h3>Processes and node</h3>

<p>For us nodesters, the picture gets a bit more complicated. The computer loads up the program instructions
we affectionatly know as node and loads it into memory. From there, the node program as a static set of
bits on the hardrive becomes an almost living thing that loads your javascript into memory and run it!</p>

<p>To clarify, the process running when you run your node program is an instance of the node program. You can
have several node instances running in memory. They can even all serve http requests as long as they are
not trying to bind to the same port.</p>

<p>Understanding processes is incredibly useful. In Ruby, processes forking is used heavily in the design of
<a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">unicorn</a>. Services like nodejitsu and heroku utilize smart people who understand
how processes work to architect systems that run and manage your code on the cloud. More importantly, node code
can only run on one processor at any given time but by using features such as <em>fork</em>, you can set up a master
node process that delegates tasks to subprocesses it spawns yourself. Since node processes are so
lightweight, you could concievably run hundreds on your system at the same time.</p>
